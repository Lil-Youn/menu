# The Weekly Menu

I rebuild the Weekly Menu from the company i am working for.
Used Xata.io for the first time in a project.

You can login into the Adminbord, edit the fields for the weekdays ( starter / main / sweet) and submit it to the database.

The Menu itself fetches the data with reactQuery from the xata.io db.

## Tech Stack

**Framework:** React, Typescript, Vite.js,

**Backend:** Xata.io , ReactQuery

## Run Locally

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Lil-Youn/menu.git

  cd my-project
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash

## ðŸš€ About Me

Hi, I'm Simon, 34 years old, a chef for 18 years, and have been working as a head chef for over 12 years.

About 9 months ago, I decided to make a change in my life. Recognizing the importance of continuous growth, I delved into coding, eager to expand my skill set.
From that moment on, everything changed drastically. I explored React, Typescript, and built frontend applications. To further enhance my progress, I embraced asking questions and seeking guidance from experienced peers.

Currently, I enjoy using Ruby on Rails for API backends and React/Typescript for the frontend.
I am experienced with Github, using Github CoPilot and Chat GPT alongside traditional resources.
